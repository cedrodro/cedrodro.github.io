My research interests are as follows:

###### **How can biological phenomena be expressed in mathematical terms?**
Many experimentally observed phenomena in biology still lack a mathematical framework.  
I aim to build such foundations and render them intelligible to theorists.
###### **What makes biological systems unique relative to those in mathematics, physics, and information theory?**
In one definition by NASA, life is characterized as “a self-sustaining chemical system capable of Darwinian evolution.”  
How does each element—molecular basis, self-sustaining dynamics, and evolution—fundamentally make a system biological?

***Technical keywords***
- chemical reactions, molecular networks, graphs
- non-equilibrium thermodynamics, dissipative systems, gradient flows
- population dynamics, evolution, optimal control
